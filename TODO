two versions of retract:
1. syntactic/direct
2. retract all matching

player authentication
* sessions for guests
* public-key crypto

game history in git repo
* commit on move
* allow forking of game through UI
* game history as submodule
* bootstrapping to current state from game history
* current ruleset should just be a text document on each commit
* repo of game templates

process move as transaction
* i.e. it either all succeeds or nothing happens
* can this be implemented within the game?

documentation
* user tutorial
* from-scratch dev tutorial

better web UI
* should be more like a text editor that translates changes into retracts & asserts to check against the rules
* handle variable names
